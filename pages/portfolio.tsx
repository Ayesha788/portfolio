      I am Ayesha, a passionate web developer specializing in building <br />
      dynamic, responsive applications using Next.js. With a background
      <br /> in Information Technology, I have a keen interest in creating
      <br />
      seamless user experiences and leveraging the power of server-side
      <br />
      rendering to enhance performance. I am continually exploring new <br />
      technologies and methodologies to improve my skills and deliver
      high-quality solutions.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>2. E-commerce Application</h3>I developed a user-friendly eCommerce
      furniture website using WordPress, offering a diverse range of furniture
      for every home and office need. The site features a seamless shopping
      experience with secure payment options, easy navigation, and detailed
      product pages. Customers can explore various categories, customize their
      choices, and enjoy a responsive design optimized for both desktop and
      mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across all platforms.
      <h3>3. Blog Platform</h3>I developed a dynamic blog website using Next.js,
      where each blog post is generated from an array of objects containing
      titles, descriptions, and images. The site features a clean and responsive
      design, ensuring an optimal experience across all devices. Users can
      easily browse through different categories, and the content is dynamically
      rendered using a for loop, providing an engaging and seamless navigation
      experience. The website also supports fast loading times, thanks to
      Next.js's server-side rendering.
      <h3>Dynamic Resume Generator</h3>I built a resume generator using Next.js,
      where users can fill out a form with their personal information, skills,
      experience, and education. The form dynamically updates the resume below
      in real time, displaying the entered details in a professional format. The
      application uses state management to instantly reflect changes, providing
      a seamless user experience. With a clean, user-friendly interface, this
      tool allows individuals to quickly generate and customize their resumes
      with ease.
